This will allow us to outgrow the market beyond the mid-term and deliver strong profitable growth thanks to our commercial optimisation and cost efficiency actions.\n\nIn Defence, growth beyond the mid-term will be driven by the ramp-up of programmes that are currently in the development phase.

FLRAA revenues will start to ramp-up in the late 2020s and, as a replacement for the Black Hawk helicopter, looks set to be a very large programme with the potential for significant export sales in addition to the US Army. Production for GCAP, a next generation combat aircraft, will see production ramping up in the mid-2030s. Rolls-Royce looks forward to powering the US Navy\u2019s MQ-25, the first autonomous refueller in aviation history.

Power generation, for example, remains highly attractive with significant long-term growth potential in data centres. Having fixed the business model in power generation, we are now able to profitably capture this growth. Additional profitable growth will come from our next generation engine in Power Systems, offering significantly improved power-density and efficiency. This differentiated product will create commercial opportunities and new market segment access from 2028 onwards.\n\nOur unique nuclear capability means that we are well-placed to capture growing demand for both SMRs and microreactors.

In November, a deep dive was held on UltraFan which covered an update of the programme, how UltraFan will contribute towards net zero and the next generation of advanced technology. In addition, a discussion took place on the UltraFan demonstrator which was delivering in line with expectations.\n\nSummary 2024 was our first full year as the SETT Committee and I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their engagement and support during the year. Our evaluation noted that this Committee had made a strong start. There is, however, more to do in 2025 in all areas of our remit. We will maintain a robust oversight of safety, both people and product, and the delivery of the sustainability strategy. The Committee is keen to learn more in respect of the technology agenda in 2025, including digital and AI, and how these impact the future of our technologies. We will continue to visit sites to ensure we can see at first-hand the progress being made.\n\nWendy Mars\n\nChair of the Safety, Energy Transition & Tech Committee", "matched_keywords": ["ai"], "created_at": "2026-01-18T19:42:40.885499+00:00", "mention_types": ["general_ambiguous"], "adoption_types": [], "adoption_confidence": {}, "risk_taxonomy": [], "risk_confidence": {}, "risk_substantiveness": null, "vendor_tags": [], "vendor_other": null}

We are making good progress towards making our own operations net zero (see page 33) but there is a lot more to decarbonise the sectors in which we operate. Our technological expertise has a crucial role to play.\n\nNew lower carbon fuels will be central to achieving net zero in the medium term across many of our markets. In commercial aero space, for instance, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the answer for large aircraft. That is why we are very pleased to have successfully reached our target of testing all our in-service Trent and business jet engines with 100% SAF in 2023. We have also been working with our armed forces customers to achieve the same for the engines they use from our Defence division. We also believe the internal combustion engine can be made compatible with net zero, through the use of sustainable fuels. This is vital as many of our customers, such as data centre and governmental clients, will continue to use combustion engines well into the future. At the end of 2023, variants of all our major Power Systems engine platforms can run on sustainable fuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil. In marine, we are developing methanol-based solutions and for power generation we see hydrogen as a future solution. All these developments are based on existing engines. In some markets, such as yachts, hybrid solutions will be key and solutions are being developed. We are also prepared for the gradual transition to battery-based solutions, with the required capabilities and products in place. We are also making increased use of new digital technologies across four areas: enhancing the customer experience; accelerating product design; improving manufacturing; and empowering our people.\n\nWe are well known for our skill in collecting engine data in order to improve the performance of our engines while in service and, with digital twin capabilities, we can forecast the time an engine stays on wing. This is improving dispatch reliability and reducing disruption for customers.\n\nOur future vision is raising the bar to 100% availability, where everything is planned and predictable, further improving the service we offer customers. Digital tools are also helping us design products more efficiently. Powerful virtual simulations and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can reduce the time it takes to develop and test a new engine. In manufacturing, we are using digital tools, such as AI machine learning, to improve our inspection regimes.

We are making excellent progress against these initiatives. In addition, the same commercial and cost disciplines are being applied to other areas of our business too, where we are targeting profitable improvements in time and material, original equipment and spare engines.\n\nWe are improving engine performance whilst maintaining excellent safety and operational availability. For example, extending time-on-wing means our engines stay in service for longer periods between shop visits, reducing the lifetime maintenance cost. We aim to improve the average time-on-wing for modern Trent engines by at least 40% over the medium term. This means that relative to today\u2019s engine standard we will extend time to overhaul by almost two years. We are spending \u00a31 billion on time-on-wing improvements as part of a multi-year programme.\n\nThis will double the time-on-wing of our Trent 1000 engine and in non-benign environments double the time-on-wing on the Trent XWB-97 as well as generating a 50% improvement in benign environments.\n\nAt the right time we believe we are well positioned to re-enter the narrow body market by choosing a partnership approach for the next engine programme. Our Ultra Fan technology is a vital step towards this. The Ultra Fan demonstrator, our next generation of engine architecture and suite of technologies, achieved a significant milestone by running to maximum power in tests. These tests also showed the power gearbox handled accelerations and decelerations 20 times faster than we have previously achieved. We expect to continue to invest in the Ultra Fan following these significant milestones.

Revenue recognised comprises sales to the Group\u2019s customers after such items. Customer concession credits are discounts given to a customer upon the sale of goods or services. Liability is recognised to correspond with the recognition of revenue when the performance obligation is met as set out on page 127.\n\nThe largest element of the balance, approximately \u00a31.2bn, arises when the Civil Aerospace division delivers its engines to an airframer. A concession is often payable to the end customer (e.g. an airline) on delivery of the aircraft from the airframer. The concession amounts are known and the payment date is reasonably certain, hence there is no significant judgement or uncertainty associated with the timing of these amounts. Warranty credits of \u00a3364m and customer concessions of \u00a31,480m have been represented at 31 December 2023 to be included within customer discounts to better reflect the nature of these balances. 2 During the year, \u00a374m, (2022: \u00a320m) of government grants were released to the income statement. 3 Other payables includes payroll liabilities and HM Government UK levies. 4 Amounts within financial instruments classified as trade payables and similar items and other non-derivative financial liabilities as at 31 December 2022 have been represented to better reflect the nature of the balance. This resulted in a decrease in trade payables and similar items of \u00a3363m and a corresponding increase in other non-derivative financial instruments. There is no impact to total trade payables and other liabilities. The Group\u2019s payment terms with suppliers vary on the products and services being sourced, the competitive global markets the Group operates in and other commercial aspects of suppliers\u2019 relationships. Industry average payment terms vary between 90 to 120 days. The Group offers reduced payment terms for smaller suppliers, who are typically on 75-day payment terms, so that they are paid in 30 days. In line with civil aviation industry practice, the Group offers an SCF programme in partnership with banks to enable suppliers, including joint ventures who are on 90-day standard payment terms, to receive their payments sooner. The SCF programme is available to suppliers at their discretion and does not change rights and obligations with suppliers or the timing of payment of suppliers. At 31 December 2023, suppliers had drawn \u00a3418m under the SCF scheme (2022: \u00a3422m) of which \u00a3154m (2022: \u00a3180m) is drawn by joint ventures. The Group, in some cases, settles the costs incurred by joint ventures as a result of them utilising either the Group offered SCF arrangement, or an alternative SCF arrangement.

Given the tenure of longer-serving directors and Leena Nair stepping down from the Board on 14 July 2022, the Committee was also planning to address future anticipated changes as a result of upcoming director departures. Russell Reynolds Associates, an independent external search consultant, who has no other connection to the BT Group, and a signatory of the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, was engaged to assist with the search. The Committee recognised that, given the group\u2019s continued focus on digital and legacy platform transformation, at least one director should have digital and technology capabilities and transformation expertise.

Russell Reynolds was tasked with enabling us to make appointments that meet the aims and targets of our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy and related targets and succession planning. In line with that brief, Russell Reynolds prepared a long list of candidates which comprised a diverse range of candidates, including female candidates and those from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nThe Committee agreed a shortlist of candidates who were formally approached by Russell Reynolds for consideration for the role and assessment. Further to a comprehensive assessment and interview process which included meetings with the Non-Executive Directors, feedback was discussed by the Committee at each stage to shortlist candidates based on the criteria and brief.\n\nThe Committee identified Steven Guggenheimer, an accomplished technology executive, with a strong track record of advising businesses on digital transformation and extensive insight into technologies ranging from artificial intelligence to cloud computing, as a preferred candidate to complement and enhance the Board\u2019s technology and digital capabilities.

The LLM it uses is generated from training manuals based on thousands of hours of real-world experience with the aircraft, which means it can give easily understood, step-by-step instructions along with references to exactly where it found the information. This could lead to significantly faster responses to support enquiries and increased uptime for Typhoon, as the assistant is able to make rapid connections between different systems in a way that a search engine alone could not achieve. The AI assistant is also able to give answers in a number of languages, so would be useful for international teams working together.\n\nWe have also operationalized an AI system to help our customers fight cyber threats. This again uses an LLM trained on nearly a decade of our expert analysis in cyber threats, which is continuously being added to as our researchers investigate new activity. The system is able to generate actionable insights for users and recommendations on how to proceed on a range of topics, from vulnerabilities in space systems through to mitigating specific tools used by criminal groups and hostile intelligence services.\n\nAI is a powerful enabler of autonomy. We have continued working with a team of government and academic leads in Australia to enable multiple Uncrewed Ground Vehicles to operate simultaneously on a future battlefield, fusing satellite and onboard sensor data to improve navigation.

Through this course and sponsorship of PhD placements at the university, we are developing systems that can dynamically plot optimal routes for unmanned vehicles, through complex and changing threat environments. One such example is a project to find safe landing areas for autonomous air vehicles during hazardous search and rescue missions, removing humans from this dangerous task.\n\nAt Manchester University, our AI data science accelerator is exploring autonomous navigation using a combination of sensors without using GPS, which can\u2019t always be relied on in contested military environments. We are using data from NASA\u2019s open CAESAR initiative, building models of our complex engineering systems and allowing us to validate that design rules are being followed throughout millions of lines of code.\n\nOur battle-ready Electronic Warfare (EW) systems are working towards a future with AI, such as in the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), which our BAE Systems, Inc. team delivers.\n\nEPAWSS implements \u2018cognitive\u2019 EW to detect, identify, analyse and jam previously unknown threats, something that previous EW systems could not do without returning to base.\n\nCognitive EW is one step closer to integrating AI into an EW system.\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has also contracted with our US business to develop new technology allowing advanced automated signal processing \u2013 vital for navigation, target detection and communication \u2013 on much smaller platforms than is currently possible.\n\nWe use our advanced electronics skills to significantly reduce the size, weight and power requirements for these computation-heavy operations.\n\nAI is used to inform the design and development process of the Future Combat Air System. It is also used to support collaborative research and development.\n\nOur intention is to further integrate our digital engineering data, helping us monitor the entire engineering lifecycle. This will mean a change to one part of the design can be assessed more quickly for any impact on other systems, rather than waiting for a time- and cost-consuming cycle of manual iterations.\n\nAutonomous Products for Air, Land and Sea\n\nIn 2023, we unveiled several new products at the world\u2019s largest defence show, the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) event.\n\nWe are designing these products to navigate autonomously as well as operate as part of a multi-domain force. There are clear benefits to unmanned systems, as they can take on a range of dangerous jobs that would otherwise need to be done by a human.

In addition, we looked for contracts that might have higher levels of judgment associated with the risk of schedule delivery or technical complexity, fixed price contracts which increase the risk of contract losses and other indicators that could increase the risk of a material impact on the financial statements.\n\nAs a result of our risk assessment, we identified one contract where we consider there to be an elevated risk of misstatement, owing to the high degree of judgment required in estimating the trading margin position impacting the 2023 financial statements.\n\nHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter Our contract testing approach included: Testing the relevant controls", "matched_keywords": ["data_analytics"], "created_at": "2026-02-06T13:02:42.126666+00:00", "mention_types": ["adoption"], "adoption_types": [], "risk_taxonomy": [], "risk_substantiveness": null, "vendor_tags": [], "vendor_other": null, "adoption_confidence": {"non_llm": 0, "llm": 0, "agentic": 0}, "risk_confidence": {}, "review_source": "human", "reviewed_at": "2026-02-06T13:02:42.126697+00:00", "source_annotation_id": "hum-gs-phase1-20260118-153020-None-2023-defence-ixbrl-chunk-e77debc32497"}

A structured approach to identify, assess and mitigate the IT and cyber security risks is built into our support processes and is benchmarked to external best practices. We continuously track cyber-attacks, threat intelligence, cyber legislation (including the EU AI Act) and vulnerabilities relevant to our IT landscape and have a well-structured incident management and escalation process in place.\n\nThe security of IT services, where operated by external IT companies, is managed through contractual clauses and additionally through formal supplier assurance reports for critical IT services. Shell collaborates biannually with third parties and supplements these reports with biannual internal benchmarking to assess our cyber security risk management practices against cyber security best practices and peer organizations. Using the insights gained from these assessments, along with changes in external risks and the outcome of internal audits and control testing results, we enhance our cyber security capabilities and adopt a risk-based strategy for our investment decisions concerning cyber risk exposure.\n\nShell employees and contract staff are required to complete mandatory training courses and participate in regular cyber threat awareness campaigns. In 2024, we introduced the Think Secure Scorecard across the organization. This provides data insights into the cyber behaviour of Shell staff on an individual level, encouraging continuous learning about cyber threats and advocating personal accountability. Shell has robust governance processes to monitor key cyber risks, provide risk assurance and encourage a corporate culture that prioritizes security.\n\nOur cyber security strategy is regularly reviewed and updated, as required, by our CISO and Shell's Information and Digital Technology leadership team, with oversight from the EC, the Audit and Risk Committee, and the Board. These reviews involve consideration of external environment changes; strategic, operational, and cultural risks; response to cyber security risks and implementation of further remedial actions as appropriate; and updates on the performance and benchmarking of the Group's cyber defences.

We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.\n\nWe assessed the susceptibility of Shell's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by embedding forensic specialists into our group engagement team. Our forensic specialists worked with the group engagement team to identify the fraud risks across various parts of the business. In addition, we utilised internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment for each of the countries of operation. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated data analytics across manual journal entries into our audit approach. We also considered the possibility of fraudulent or corrupt payments made through third parties, gaining a detailed understanding of the Company's monitoring and compliance activities related to vendor screening and due diligence. Where deemed appropriate we conducted analytical testing on third-party vendors in high-risk jurisdictions. We utilised a suite of digital tools in our assessment of fraud and management override including technology that seeks to verify the authenticity of key documents.\n\nWe also conducted specific audit procedures in relation to the risk of bribery, corruption and sanctions compliance across various countries of operation determined on a risk-based approach.\n\nBased on the results of our risk assessment, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified above.

We have observed an increase in social engineering (manipulation of individuals) as a method of financially driven cyber crime. Threat actors are targeting bank account changes, invoice settlement and identity fraud to extract money from corporations. Ransomware attacks on corporations continue to be widespread. These contribute to potential breaches and disruptions of critical IT services, such as the security incident involving the transfer of files which Shell experienced in 2023.

For example, improvements in digital servicing mean that more than 70 percent of new Business Banking and SME lending decisions are now automated. As a further example of productivity enhancement, we increased the number of active customers served per FTE by more than 30 percent.\n\nLooking forward, we will continue to hire new engineering talent, scale cloud adoption and accelerate decommissioning activity. This will allow us to continue to adopt new technologies that deliver a step-change in our capabilities. This includes our aspirations for Gen AI, for which we have created a centre of excellence including around 200 data scientists and engineers. We are developing use cases such as our knowledge support tool currently being rolled out to 10,000 colleagues across the Group and an AI-driven money management tool for our Mass Affluent customers. These initiatives will generate further efficiencies as well as create opportunities for growth.\n\nTogether, they drive operating leverage, helping towards our target of a cost:income ratio of less than 50 percent by 2026. We are making strong progress on our purpose-led strategy.\n\nWe have generated \u00a30.8 billion of additional revenues from strategic initiatives as we return the business to growth. We are transforming our franchise through innovative propositions and enhanced capabilities. This gives us confidence in further business growth and our ambition to generate more than \u00a31.5 billion in additional income from our strategic initiatives by 2026 whilst remaining disciplined around costs and capital. We are progressing well towards delivering higher, more sustainable returns for shareholders.", "matched_keywords": ["ai", "gen_ai"], "created_at": "2026-01-19T13:41:31.016831+00:00", "mention_types": ["adoption", "general_ambiguous"], "adoption_types": ["non_llm", "llm"], "adoption_confidence": {"non_llm": 3, "llm": 3, "agentic": 0}, "risk_taxonomy": [], "risk_confidence": {}, "risk_substantiveness": null, "vendor_tags": [], "vendor_other": null}

Our scientists and AI engineers use these technologies when solving chemistry, biology, pathology and clinical business problems.\n\nOur investments in AI and new solutions also improve how we launch new medicines and help transform patient outcomes. We are deploying these technologies to enhance the healthcare provider experience, expand our patient assistance programs and improve how patients navigate the health ecosystem to manage their care. For example, our Rare Disease therapy area uses data and AI to identify patients, drive early diagnoses and accelerate their treatment in areas of high unmet medical need.\n\nWe have created a robust, in-house program for generative AI, identifying eight architecture patterns that cover use cases across AstraZeneca. This framework, which will be rolled out in 2024, ensures we are addressing the ethical, data privacy, legal and procurement requirements needed to fully leverage this new technology in a responsible way.\n\nIn Operations, we continue to automate our manufacturing facilities to drive productivity improvement through optimizing material and information flow, increasing process yields and driving right first time quality. For example, one of our global \u2018digital lighthouse\u2019 sites in Wuxi, China has already achieved top decile performance in quality, speed and performance through the use of an integrated Lean Digital approach.\n\nWe ensure robust governance via the enterprise data office, which empowers the enterprise data council to strengthen the Group\u2019s data governance. This approach ensures that our data policies and standards are streamlined, clear and effective.\n\nOur ongoing commitment to training helps our teams take full advantage of fast-developing new technologies to deliver innovation at pace across the organization. This includes partnering with our HR and Learning & Development teams to upskill the entire organization to help maximize the benefits of generative AI. We also invest in talent at our Global Technology Innovation Centres in Guadalajara, Mexico and Chennai, India as we prepare to scale our business for future growth.\n\nFor information on how we manage cybersecurity risks, see Risk Overview from page 54.\n\nAccelerating the delivery of enhanced value in Global Operations Innovative technology platforms will transform the way new medicines are developed, manufactured and launched.

The likely scale of this impact is still evolving and we are monitoring closely.\n\n\u2022 Cyber security and resilience are key priorities for us, as is the ethical and safe use of generative AI technologies.\n\nHow we are responding\n\n\u2022 In Upstate New York, we have installed 128,000 of a planned 1.7 million of advanced next-generation electricity meters, enabling customers to understand their energy usage, allowing us to deliver innovative new tariffs and to detect network faults more quickly. In Massachusetts, we have just launched a similar programme to replace 1.4 million electricity meters.\n\n\u2022 We invest in technology to unlock flexibility in supply and demand and to provide targeted solutions to network constraints, as reflected in UK ED\u2019s DSO Strategic Action Plan, launched in March 2024.\n\n\u2022 We are constantly innovating to reduce emissions from our own operations and have declared that all our assets will be free of Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6), an insulating gas which is harmful to the environment, by 2050. The alternative we have developed (g3), is significantly less harmful to the environment and is being deployed at our substations.\n\n\u2022 National Grid Partners has invested c.$470 million in 50 startups and strategic funds since 2018. Four of the investments are in companies that have exceeded a $1 billion valuation. Our portfolio includes leading edge electricity network technologies, such as advanced conductors and dynamic line rating which will help us expand capacity on our existing networks, as well as companies that use artificial intelligence to help us improve cyber security and maintain our networks.\n\n\u2022 We have established a leadership and governance group for generative AI, and in January 2024, after trials in the US and UK, we launched GridGPT, our internal generative AI service, which is protected from the public domain.\n\n\u2022 Our market analytics team is modelling scenarios for the future development of AI and data centre demand growth, and we are working with the sector on its connection needs.\n\n\u2022 We are compliant with NERC CIP standards for cyber security in the US. In the UK, we are compliant with similar Network and Information Systems (NIS) regulations. Across National Grid, we robustly monitor cyber risk, with a comprehensive set of controls, including training and interactive campaigns to test engagement of employees. In the UK, we are constructing a new Network Control Centre to deliver improvements to physical and cyber security, as well as delivering greater operational capability.\n\nOur business environment continued", "matched_keywords": ["ai", "artificial_intelligence", "generative_ai"], "created_at": "2026-02-10T12:07:42.069155+00:00", "mention_types": ["adoption", "risk", "general_ambiguous", "vendor"], "adoption_types": ["non_llm", "llm"], "risk_taxonomy": ["cybersecurity", "environmental_impact", "operational_technical", "reputational_ethical", "strategic_competitive"], "risk_substantiveness": "substantive", "vendor_tags": [], "vendor_other": null, "adoption_confidence": {"non_llm": 3, "llm": 3, "agentic": 0}, "risk_confidence": {"environmental_impact": 2, "cybersecurity": 1, "reputational_ethical": 1, "operational_technical": 1, "strategic_competitive": 1}, "review_source": "custom", "reviewed_at": "2026-02-10T12:07:42.069224+00:00", "source_annotation_id": null, "risk_signals": [{"type": "environmental_impact", "signal": 2}, {"type": "cybersecurity", "signal": 1}, {"type": "reputational_ethical", "signal": 1}, {"type": "operational_technical", "signal": 1}, {"type": "strategic_competitive", "signal": 1}], "vendor_confidence": {}}

The submissions included for the first time a Long-Term Delivery Strategy (\u2018LTDS\u2019). The LTDS seeks to link our proposed five-year investment programme to 2030 with longer-term objectives to 2050 and in doing so has considered all recommended warming scenarios, from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C. It provides insight into how our investment plans would differ under a diverse range of assumptions across climate change, demand, water abstraction conditions and technology. This informed our core and adaptive pathways, supported by monitoring a range of triggers to evaluate if, in future business cycles, we should make different investment choices to respond to changing circumstances, including key climate change metrics.

Issues that dominate media headlines \u2013 including artificial intelligence (AI), climate change, societal trends or geopolitical tensions \u2013 are intrinsically tied to the value of the assets we invest in.

As a result, the status quo in many industries is being disrupted more frequently and the leadership of historically successful companies undermined.\n\nThe winning companies, regions and asset classes of tomorrow will look different from the leaders of yesterday.

To support blind or partially sighted people Avanti has also included within this channel, Be My Eyes \u2013 a free app offering video support at a moment\u2019s notice from sighted volunteers and professionals who lend their eyes to solve tasks.\n\nTravellers who are deaf or have hearing loss often struggle to hear station announcements and communicate with staff, which can make it harder to plan and carry out journeys. Both SWR and TPE have trialled Artificial Intelligence technology at various stations this year which translates live journey information into British Sign Language (BSL). This is displayed through a figure on digital totem screens, giving them more confidence on their journeys.\n\nOur project to deploy superfast on-board 5G Wi-Fi for SWR customers between Basingstoke and Earlsfield is underway.\n\nEngineers for the project by evo-rail and SWR, in partnership with Network Rail, have now installed the first series of rail-5G poles on the line between the stations on the South West Main Line. It will be the first railway line in the mainland UK to deploy the industry-leading rail-5G technology for customer use. With over 100 trains already fitted to accommodate the solution, the technology will cover 70km of the SWR network.", "matched_keywords": ["artificial_intelligence"], "created_at": "2026-01-19T15:56:21.512392+00:00", "mention_types": ["adoption"], "adoption_types": ["non_llm", "llm"], "adoption_confidence": {"non_llm": 3, "llm": 1, "agentic": 0}, "risk_taxonomy": [], "risk_confidence": {}, "risk_substantiveness": null, "vendor_tags": [], "vendor_other": null}

We continue to be part of the first ever Air Quality Monitoring Network across 105 stations in England and Wales. Our rail businesses have installed diffusion tubes and other monitoring equipment at various stations to monitor nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.

As part of this, we continue to retrofit Exhaust After\u2011Treatment Systems (EATS) to older diesel vehicles and we now have more than 1,600 retrofitted vehicles in our fleet.
