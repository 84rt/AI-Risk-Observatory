mention_type: |
  You are an expert analyst labelling AI mentions from company annual reports.

  ## CONTEXT
  Company: {firm_name}
  Sector: {sector}
  Report Year: {report_year}
  Report Section: {report_section}

  ## TASK
  Classify the excerpt into zero or more mention types. Mention types are NOT mutually exclusive.
  If excerpt is a false positive (no AI mention), return the "none" tag.
  Add confidence scores only for the tags in mention_types. 
  The excerpts often contain multiple unrelated sentences. Make sure that the tags you assign are only to the sentences talking about AI, not the excerpt as a whole.

  ## EXAMPLES
  - "We deployed an AI chatbot for customer support." -> adoption ~0.9
  - "AI could increase misinformation risks. Deepfakes have significantly impaired our value proposition" -> risk ~0.8, harm ~0.8
  - "We are exploring AI opportunities." -> general_ambiguous ~0.7
  - "Automation of customer service tasks improved our..." -> general_ambiguous ~0.2
  - "Our office in Shangh'ai' has opp..." -> none ~0.9
  
  ## MENTION TYPES (DEFINITIONS)
  - adoption: Concrete mention of deployment, use, rollout, pilot, or implementation of AI within the company
    or for their clients. Mentions of internal AI tooling or customer-facing systems. Adoption requires explicit company-specific language (we/our/our clients) or an explicit implementation/pilot; otherwise use general_ambiguous. If the mention is vague assign it very low confidence.
  - risk: AI described as a risk, or a material concern to the company (i.e. legal, cybersecurity, operational, reputational, or regulatory risk directly related to AI). Make sure to only assign this tag if the risk is directly related to AI, the probability of an unrelated other risk mention in the excerpt is high. 
    security, operational, reputational, or regulatory risk).
  - harm: AI discussed as causing harm or enabling harm (misinformation, fraud, cyber abuse,
    safety incidents, discrimination, etc.).
  - vendor: Explicit mention of an AI vendor or platform (Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, AWS, etc.)
    or a named third-party provider of AI capabilities.
  - general_ambiguous: High-level plans, opportunities, strategy, or vague statements that do
    not clearly fit adoption, risk, harm, or vendor.

  ## CONFIDENCE GUIDANCE (0.0-1.0)
  - 0.0: confident NO — clear absence of this mention type
  - 0.2: faint/implicit signal; could be this type but hard to tell
  - 0.5: highly uncertain — no strong evidence either way
  - 0.8: likely YES — strong signal, but not fully explicit
  - 1.0: confident YES — explicit, unambiguous mention

adoption_type: |
  You are an expert analyst classifying the type of AI adoption in company annual reports.

  ## CONTEXT
  Company: {firm_name}
  Sector: {sector}
  Report Year: {report_year}

  ## TASK
  The excerpt has been classified to have the following mention types: {mention_types}.
  Identify the AI adoption type(s) present. Categories are NOT mutually exclusive.
  If the excerpt is vague, assign low confidences instead of inventing a category.
  Include all adoption_confidences keys with numeric values (0.0-1.0).

  ## EXAMPLES
  - "We deployed a GPT-based chatbot for HR." -> llm ~0.9
  - "We use predictive analytics to detect fraud." -> non_llm ~0.9
  - "We are rolling out AI agents to automate workflows." -> agentic ~0.9, llm ~0.4
  - "In 2024, our AI platform fully automated customer service tasks." -> non_llm ~0.3, llm ~0.6, agentic ~0.8

risk: |
  You are an expert analyst classifying the type of AI risks in company annual reports.

  ## CONTEXT
  Company: {firm_name}
  Sector: {sector}
  Report Year: {report_year}
  Report Section: {report_section}

  ## TASK
  The excerpt has been classified to have the following mention types: {mention_types}.
  Identify ALL applicable AI risk categories. Categories are NOT mutually exclusive.
  If a risk spans multiple categories, include all that apply.
  If the excerpt is too vague, use "none".
  Remember that if a vague statments on risk that is not directly related to AI, should be classified as none and when you are uncertian assign lower confidence.

  ## EXAMPLES
  - "Increasing risk from new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a major concern." -> none ~0.8
  - "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is posing increasing cyberse∫curity concerns." -> cybersecurity ~0.9
  - "[In the Risk Section] Digital threats and cybersecurity risks are evolving rapidly." -> none ~0.8 (no AI mention)
  - "We might fail to adopt AI technologies in a timely manner." -> strategic_market ~0.9
  - "[In the Risk Section] The increasing regulation, especially the AI Act, are difficult to comply with and might result in legal liability." -> regulatory_compliance ~0.9
  - "Deepfakes and GenAI can cause misinformation and damage to our reputation." -> reputational_ethical ~0.9, information_integrity ~0.9
  - "Continued geopolitical tensions require extra focus on reputational risks associated with our global operations. Rapid advances in AI bring stakeholder scrutiny on topics like data ethics, reskilling and supply chain risks." -> workforce_impacts ~0.8, reputational_ethical ~0.9, third_party_supply_chain ~0.2

vendor: |
  You are an expert analyst extracting AI vendor mentions from company annual reports.

  ## CONTEXT
  Company: {firm_name}
  Sector: {sector}
  Report Year: {report_year}

  ## TASK
  Identify AI vendors or providers explicitly mentioned in the excerpt.
  Use only the vendor tags listed in the schema.
  If a named vendor is not in the list, use "other" and set other_vendor.

  ## EXAMPLES
  - "We partner with Microsoft for AI tooling." -> microsoft ~0.9
  - "We use a third-party AI provider." -> undisclosed ~0.7
  - "Our in-house AI models..." -> internal ~0.8
  - "We use Anthropic models." -> other ~0.8, other_vendor: "Anthropic"

  ## CONTEXT
  Company: {firm_name}

  ## TASK
  The excerpt has been classified to have the following mention types: {mention_types}.
  Classify the AI-related content as boilerplate, contextual, or substantive.

  - "AI may pose risks to our industry." -> contextual ~0.7
