Here is a list of things I would like to get done today:



1. Improve the chunk creation keyword match (we are getting a lot of false positives - number of human None mentions)
2. Replace the label from None/Unclear to Unclear/None
3. The Dashboard should be waiting to display the final results
5. Pick a few documents to test in a browser against Cmd+F and human eye (sanity check if we are not missing obvious things)
6. Create the pre-report aggregation script (instead of showing all mentions, it should pick "the labels" per report (as a proxy for a given company in that year))
7. Refine the prompts used on the Classifers, use only one set of comprehsnsive prompts, no split between batch and normal prompts. These prompts should be succinct and comprehensive - mostly written by hand (but a little bit refined by AI). 
	- [ ] Write better prompts 
	- [ ] Test them on small batch 
8. Do reaseach on how to decrease the cost of running the pipeline.
    - [ ] Can we use batch API?
    - [ ] Can we catch the prompts?
	- [ ] Is suing Google Cloud API directly cheaper?
