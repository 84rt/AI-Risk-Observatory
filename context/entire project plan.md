- FTSE100/250/350 has tighter requirements than AIM. (unless they voluntarily meet "Public Interest Entity" thresholds). -> treat these as separate datasets
- The 2024 Corporate Governance Code update (Provision 29) requires boards to review "material controls," including reporting controls. This has caused a surge in AI mentions related to internal controls and digital reporting tools rather than business risks.
- A lot of AI washing -> For Risks look at only the data from the risk section. 
- Double double-down on boilerplate detection and classification (“evolving regulatory landscape”)
	- The better we can measure this the better. (i.e. change of boilerplateness over time) 
- Studies show that LLMs perform better at "System 2" reasoning (deliberate deduction) on structured financial statements (10-Ks) compared to unstructured sentiment analysis -> this makes them perfect for:  "ground truth" baseline to validate other signals instead of "real-time monitor”. (use the Annual Report to confirm if "soft" risks mentioned in news/transcripts have materialized into "hard" financial risks) <- there is a lag in reporting. 
- Post data direction: correlate trend data with filings (cyber spending and attacks | job displacements) 


actionables from the call with Andrew:
- Scale the reports to 100
- make the dashboard leggible (terminology explenations)
- sector breakdown / translation prom CNI to ISIC
- expand the dataset to contain more metadata 
- stretch deliverables (mockup dashboard optiions)
    - list clearly what is stretch and what is non-stretch


general project progress:
- usable dashboard
- dataset
- report
    - methodology
    - tests run
    - literature review
    - current findings in the data
