# AI Risk Observatory

the repo contains both front end visualization of the data findings and the data processing pipeline. 

1. Can LLMs reliably identify and classify mentions of AI risk in finacial reports 
    The fall back here is to use more classic AI mehtodology for this task
2. Given the identification of AI related risks in finencial filigns show them over time with respect to:
    adoption rates, and the type, sector, and severity of harms. 
    (Motivation: This may offer an effective and standardised approach to tracking the adoption, risks, and impacts of frontier AI)



The end goal of the project:
- consistent methodology and data set to help:
    - Identify emerging threats.
    - Engage sector regulators.
    - Prioritise interventions
